# Project 2
## This is Project 2 in GA's SEIR Program.

### Summary:

This project consists of a CRUD app used to upload images to a database for viewing. It also has the ability to delete images from the database. The application uses the following technologies:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* EJS

### Unsolved Problems:

I wasn't able to get my CSS styling to take effect on the page, and I was also unable to get connected to Atlas DB to populate my cloud database and had to present my project from local. I plan on resolving this in the future, as well as adding some to the app and making it more interactive.
